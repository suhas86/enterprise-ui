Import the `expect` function from Vitest, which is used for writing test assertions.

```javascript 
import { expect } from "vitest";
````
Import all matchers from `@testing-library/jest-dom/matchers`.
// These matchers extend Jest's built-in assertions to make them more readable and useful for testing DOM elements.
```javascript 
import \* as matchers from "@testing-library/jest-dom/matchers";
````

Import `@testing-library/jest-dom` to enable additional matchers like `.toBeInTheDocument()`, `.toHaveTextContent()`, etc.
```javascript 
import "@testing-library/jest-dom";
````

Extend Vitest's `expect` function with the additional matchers from `jest-dom`.
This allows us to use matchers like `expect(element).toBeInTheDocument()`.
```javascript 
expect.extend(matchers);
````


## Explanation

### 1. **Importing `expect` from Vitest**
- Vitest provides its own `expect` function for assertions in tests.
- This ensures that we are using the correct `expect` from Vitest instead of Jest.

### 2. **Importing Jest-DOM Matchers**
- `@testing-library/jest-dom/matchers` provides additional matchers for testing DOM elements.
- Examples include:
  - `.toBeInTheDocument()`
  - `.toHaveTextContent()`
  - `.toHaveAttribute()`

### 3. **Importing `@testing-library/jest-dom`**
- This ensures that the extended matchers work globally in our test environment.

### 4. **Extending `expect` with Jest-DOM Matchers**
- `expect.extend(matchers);` adds these matchers to Vitestâ€™s `expect`, so we can use them in our tests.

## **Why This Is Needed?**
- Vitest supports global `expect`, but Jest-DOM matchers are not included by default.
- Manually extending `expect` ensures that all tests have access to DOM-specific assertions.
